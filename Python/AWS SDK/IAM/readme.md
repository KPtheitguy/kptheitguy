# AWS VPN Management API

This project provides a FastAPI application to manage AWS VPN connections. The API includes endpoints to create VPN connections, list existing VPN connections, and download VPN configurations.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- AWS account credentials with permissions to manage VPN connections
- `pip` package manager

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repository/aws-vpn-management-api.git
    cd aws-vpn-management-api
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## AWS IAM Role and Policy

You need to create an IAM role with the necessary permissions to manage VPN connections.

### IAM Policy

Create an IAM policy with the following permissions:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeVpnConnections",
                "ec2:DescribeVpnGateways",
                "ec2:DescribeCustomerGateways",
                "ec2:CreateCustomerGateway",
                "ec2:CreateVpnConnection",
                "ec2:DescribeRouteTables",
                "ec2:DescribeSubnets",
                "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeVpcs"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

# Steps to Create IAM Role

Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
Go to the IAM service.
In the navigation pane, choose Policies and then Create policy.
Choose the JSON tab and paste the policy JSON above.
Choose Review policy.
Enter a name and description for the policy and choose Create policy.
In the navigation pane, choose Roles and then Create role.
Choose EC2 as the trusted entity and choose Next: Permissions.
Attach the policy you just created and choose Next: Tags.
(Optional) Add metadata to the role by attaching tags as keyâ€“value pairs and choose Next: Review.
Enter a role name and description, then choose Create role.
Running the Application

Navigate to the main directory: 
cd main

Start the FastAPI application:
uvicorn main:app --reload
